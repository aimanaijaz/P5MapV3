Instructions

This application locates popular malls in Long Island on a google map using google map markers.   
It uses AJAX to retrieve information about these malls from Wikipedia.   
This information is displayed in infowindows.  

You can use the search bar to search for malls from the list present on the right hand side (Desktop) or below (Mobile Devices).    
You can also click on a mall of your choice from the list view. 
Selecting a mall by either clicking on it ( on the marker or list view) or by searching for it will cause an infowindow to pop which displays information about the mall to appear above the marker.   

The application has been designed responsively. Two stylesheets have been used styles.css and over600.css to make the map look good on all devices.   

This application has been optimized by using gulp. The minifed files are present on the gh-pages branch.
